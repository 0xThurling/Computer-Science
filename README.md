# Computer Science Learning (Based on OSSU). 
### Total Progress: ![Pub Popularity](https://img.shields.io/badge/progress-2%25-brightgreen)

> Some of the courses are behind a paywall/outdated - please note this isn't a alternative, this is a version of the OSSU curriculum based on personal goals and problems I found going through the content. (Khan Academy is used as a Gentle Introduction to topics before going into more rigorous mathematics programs)

> P.S As these are based on personal goals, there are additional subjects which isn't necessary

# Curriculum

## Intro CS

### Introduction to Computer Science

This course will introduce you to the world of computer science. Students who have been introduced to programming, either from the courses above or through study elsewhere, should take this course for a flavor of the material to come. If you finish the course wanting more, Computer Science is likely for you!

**Topics covered**:
`computation`
`imperative programming`
`basic data structures and algorithms`
`and more`
